* Effects: Vicious Mockery tweaked.

# 2.9.12

* Auril's forms did not parse legendary resistance.

# 2.9.11

# 2.9.10

* Fix fo `fixCritters` function if import screen was not open.
* Try and improve weird errors importing monsters.
* Monsters parsing: some features with recharge (e.g. Giant Spiders web) could come in as weapons, which don't support recharge. @callbritton#5405
* Character: Customised Actions will now carry over attack and damage bonuses. This resulted in a rewrite of the core functionality here so please let me know if anything looks off/broken for items or spells. @Icoshi#2431

# 2.9.9

* Items would duplicate/nest condition links to SRD conditions.
* Fly speed would not parse on Fairy.
* Some items would not generate speed effects, e.g. Broomstick
* If you have actors in DDB Monsters compendium that were not created outside of DDB but you now wish to link, you can use `DDBImporter.fixCritters()` from a macro or within the browser developer console to add the DDB Id to any matching actors (by name). This is necessary as recently the Importer started checking for a name and the DDB id in order to support multiple actors with the same name in the compendium.

# 2.9.8

* Adventure Uploads using S3 bucket failed.
* Keep "GM Notes"(module) on character imports.

# 2.9.7

* Effects: First pass at Battle Master maneuvers. Please note that some of the effects have saves which apply a status, but currently if the check is passed the damage is not applied (but should be). @dinesh#9364

Channel Divinity, Superiority Dice, Sorcery Points, Bardic Inspiration, Wild Shape, Grit Points, Psionic Power (Fighter and Rogue), and Ki Points. Please let me know if any features are not linking, have incorrect values or I have missed a feature that could use this.
* Using artificer extras without artificer levels could cause import of extras to fail.
* A number of icon additions to the icon sets.

* Correct Hideous Laughter effect saveDC not passing through correctly.
* Monster muncher will now use the default token settings as it's base value for token settings.


# 2.9.2

* A v8 import bug if DAE was not enabled @BlitheRapier888#1464

# 2.9.1

* Adventure Muncher would sometimes try and convert svgs to webp. It should no longer do this.

# 2.9.0

* [Experimental] New setting in core settings to enable webp mode. This will convert all images when loaded through muncher or characters into webp files. What is webp? It's a image storage format that makes images very small. Note if you turn this on and update monsters/spells/items/etc it won't remove the old images - you'll have to do that manually. Consider changing the upload directories for images both for characters and adventures if you wish to migrate stuff to save space.
* When choosing to hide the display dialogue setting for character resource manager, it would not always update the resources @kid2407 / Tobias#6450
* Support for midi-qol flag changes in 0.9.14.

# 2.8.14

* Spells: Control weather range changed to miles

* Monster munch: experimental feature: attempt to set AC based on armor items. This works for most monsters.

Item effects generated:

* Unarmoured AC and bonuses
* Saving throw bonuses
* Ability Check bonuses and advantage on saves and checks
* Skill check bonuses and advantage on saves and checks
* Ability bonuses
* Proficiency bonuses
* Ability score over-rides (e.g. belt of x strength)

* Damage Resistance, Immunity and Vulnerabilities
* Condition immunities
* Languages
* Darkvision, blindsight base and bonuses
* Speed/movement
* Proficiencies
* HP per level
* Skill bonuses
* Advantage on skill checks
* Advantage on initiative
* Advantage on saves vs magical attacks
* AC base effects on armor items

Character, racial traits, and background effects generated:
* AC base effects on character features
* Same as item effects, except several features don't get a feature in foundry (e.g. Ability increases).

Notes:
* When importing characters and auto generating effects, the import will be significantly slower due to some race conditions around effect generation when updating characters.
* Some effects may not come through for some items, these tend to be ones with very specific advantages, e.g. Advantage on Persuasion vs Giants and the like. There exceptions such as the Cloak of Elvenkind, or resistances where you should be holding the item.
* It adds only a limited number of more specialist effects.
* You can use this in combination with Copy Effects for DAE SRD.

Other Improvements:

* You can generate a set of Character Effects for each of your equipped AC options. This is similar to the DAE Auto Generate AC option, however, these will over-ride DAE and effects applied by equipping items. AC is quite hard to calculate dynamically in Foundry in edge cases as it requires users to active the correct set of effects that apply. Not all effects (e.g. from class features) are currently generated.
* Pressing enter in the monster search field no longer reloads the page.
* Homebrew monster parsing improvements.
* A handful of monsters had some odd formatting for their special traits which broke special trait and spell parsing.

* For monster abilities that have a recharge function (e.g Hell Hounds breath) this now does the correct resource linking for the recharge.

* Monster munch: improved parsing for a handful of monsters where special actions did not parse properly, e.g. Obzedat Ghost.
* Monster munch: improved parsing for monsters with tables e.g. variant troll.
* Monster munch: some monsters had their Roleplaying descriptions defined as actions, these now parse into the character biography. e.g. Augrek Brighthelm.
* Monster munch: some monsters like Worvil “the Weevil” Forkbeard had action names for items that duplicated.
